# Apple Game
Each apple reflected a part of human desire: greed, temptation, restraint, and decay.

Life is all about desire. Your task is to balance your desire between hunger and restraint. To survive, you must eat… but not too much. To resist, you must endure… but not too long.

SCORE: Red apple: Balance. The natural, moderate desire. +20 score +20 desire gauge Golden apple: Temptation with risk. High value, low desire gain.? +80 score -10 desire gauge Rotten apple: Corrupted desire. Low value, but fills you dangerously fast. +5 score +40 desire gauge Missed apple: +0 score -20 desire gauge

⚖️ Goal: Maintain your Desire Gauge between 30 and 80 while collecting as many points as possible.

If Desire < 30 → “Apathy” (Game Over: You lose the will to live)

If Desire > 80 → “Obsession” (Game Over: You are consumed by greed)

<Opening>
BGM: Deep orchestral strings, slow heartbeat-like percussion, echoing choir.

[Scene 1 – Darkness]
A single red apple falls from the sky, landing on the ground with a soft thud.
    “The apple reflects the desire of mankind.” 

[Scene 2 – Golden Light]
A golden apple descends slowly, glowing in radiant light.
    “Some desires shine brighter than others…”
    “...tempting, precious, yet fleeting.”

[Scene 3 – Decay Spreads]
The light fades. A rotten apple drops, bursting into dark mist.
    “But every desire carries danger within.”
    “Corruption follows those who crave too much.”

[Scene 4 – Dual Fall]
A golden and rotten apple fall together—both spinning in slow motion.
    “We must choose…”
    “Which desire will we fulfill?” 

[Scene 5 – Storm of Apples]
Hundreds of apples fall from the sky — red, gold, and rotten — mixing in chaos.
    “At times, choice is not a gift...”
    “...but a necessity.”

[Scene 6 – Player Controllable]
    “How will you endure your own desire?”
    “Find the balance… or be devoured by it.”
